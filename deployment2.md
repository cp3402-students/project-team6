# Deployment and Development Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for developing and deploying theme updates for our website project. We leverage WordPress, Git version control on Github, Docker for local development, Trello for project management, Discord/Slack for communication, Azure App Service for staging, and AWS Lightsail for production.

### Project Management
- **Trello**
    - We use Trello boards to organize tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
    - Create cards for each development task with detailed descriptions and checklists.
    - Assign cards to developers and track progress within Trello.
    - Utilize communication tools (Discord/Slack) for discussions related to tasks.
