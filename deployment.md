WordPress excels at allowing users, even those without coding experience, to easily create, edit, and publish content on their website. This includes text, images, videos, and other media.  This user-friendly approach empowers you to maintain and update your site without relying on a developer for every change.

## Local Environment and IDE - Docker and PHPStorm
Docker is a suite of platform-as-a-service products that utilize OS-level virtualization to deploy software in containers. 
The component responsible for hosting these containers is known as Docker Engine.

PhpStorm is a lightweight PHP IDE by JetBrains, optimizing developer productivity with smart code tools and intuitive 
error checking. It offers features for code navigation, completion, unit testing, and visual debugging.
## Version Control - GitHub
Version control was managed through GitHub. Each developer had their own individual branch. Developers would commit to 
their own branch, which was then reviewed by another developer before being merged into the main branch, once deemed an
appropriate addition.

## Setup - Local Enviroment
