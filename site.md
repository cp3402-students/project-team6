# Site
## Goal:
The goal of this website is to create an updated and modern recreation of the existing site to improve ease of use and
increase membership signups.
## Success Evaluation:
Following the initial launch of the site, if there is a 10% increase in users compared to the existing membership within 
the first 3 months, the site will be considered successful.
## Target Audience:
The site is targeted towards individuals aged 55 and above, specifically those around the age of 85 who have an interest
in learning. This is a national organization for Australia, initially funded by the Australian Government. To cater to 
this target audience, the theme should be easy to navigate, and all fonts should be larger in size for older users.
## Market Size:
The population of Australia as of writing this is over 26 million, with 28.7% being over the age of 55. One study showed
that approximately 34% of Australians over the age of 55 are digitally disengaged, which means we have a potential 
market of 2.5 million users over the age of 55.

## Site Organization and Updating:
For any developer continuing the development of the site.
